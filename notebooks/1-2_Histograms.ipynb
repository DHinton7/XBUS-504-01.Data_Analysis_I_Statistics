    "* Bins are used to create bars. Bins are all equal width.\n",
    "* Height of bars represent frequency or proportion of values in each bin.\n",
    "* Bars touch because data is __continuous__ and each bar begins where the previous bin ends.\n",
    "* Generally, each bin is __inclusive__ on the left and __exclusive__ on the right.\n",
    "* Changing the number of bins can have a big impact on how the data appears. Experiment with different numbers of bins to find a display that communicates the data as clearly and accurately as possible. "
