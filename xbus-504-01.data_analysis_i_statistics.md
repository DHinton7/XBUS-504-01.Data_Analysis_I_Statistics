# XBUS-504-01.Data_Analysis_I_Statistics

## Course Details
The fields of statistics and probability were founded on empirical analysis of data (e.g. human height). Data scientists must possess a strong foundation in statistics and probability to uncover patterns and build models, algorithms, and simulations. This course reviews the basics of descriptive and inferential statistics, distributions, probability, and regression with a specific focus on application to real data sets. 

## Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of the course, students will:

* Explain descriptive and inferential statistics
* Compute measures of central tendency, variance, and probabilities 
* Produce and interpret meaningful and accurate summary statistics for a given data set
* Conduct hypothesis tests and understand the difference between Type I and Type II errors
* Develop single and multivariate regression models
* Differentiate between correlation and causation
 

## Notes
Enrollment in this course is restricted. Students must submit an application and be accepted into the [Certificate in Data Science](http://scs.georgetown.edu/programs_nc/CE0124/data-analytics) in order to register for this course.

Current Georgetown students must create an application using their Georgetown NetID and password. New students will be prompted to create an account.
