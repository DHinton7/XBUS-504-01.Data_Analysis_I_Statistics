    "In a 1973 paper, *Graphs in Statistical Analysis*, published in *The American Statistician*, Vol. 27, No. 1. (Feb., 1973), pp. 17-21, statistician Francis Anscombe provided the briefiest of abstracts: *\"Graphs are essential to good statistical analysis\"*.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough; \n",
    "2. for any particular kind of statistical data there is just one set of calculations constituting a correct statistical analysis; \n",
    "3. performing intricate calculations is virtuous, whereas actually looking at the data is cheating. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer should make both calculations and graphs. Both sorts of output should be studied; each will contribute to understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can have various purposes, such as: (i) to help us perceive and appreciate some broad features of the data, (ii) to let us look behind those broad features and see what else is there. Most kinds of statistical calculation rest on assumptions about the behavior of the data. Those assumptions may be false, and then the calculations may be misleading. We ought always to try to check whether the assumptions are reasonably correct; and if they are wrong we ought to be able to perceive in what ways they are wrong. Graphs are very valuable for these purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good statistical analysis is not a purely routine matter, and generally calls for more than one pass through the computer. The analysis should be sensitive both to peculiar features in the given numbers and also to whatever background information is available about the variables. The latter is particularly helpful in suggesting alternative ways of setting up the analysis. Thought and ingenuity devoted to devising good graphs are likely to pay off. Many ideas can be gleaned from the literature...</em>"

    "<blockquote>Graphical output such as described above is readily available to anyone who does his own programming. I myself habitually generate such plots at an APL terminal, and have come to appreciate their importance. A skilled Fortran or PL/1 programmer, with an organized library of subroutines, can do the same (on a larger scale). Unfortunately, most persons who have recourse to a computer for statistical analysis of data are not much interested either in computer programming or in statistical method, being primarily concerned with their own proper business. Hence the common use of library programs and various statistical packages. Most of these originated in the pre-visual era. The user is not showered with graphical displays. He can get them only with trouble, cunning and a fighting spirit. It's time that was changed.</blockquote>"

Graphical displays are everywhere, and libraries such as *ggplot* that are rooted in a sound *grammatical* basis mean that we are now in a position to \"write\" very powerful expressions that can generate statistical graphics for us, directly from a cleaned and prepared dataset, using just a few well chosen phrases.
